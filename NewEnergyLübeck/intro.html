            <h1 class="intro_title">Our mission is to arouse your awareness of the new energy</h1>
            <p class="intro_description">On behalf of environmental friendliness, this website aims to encourage users
                to consume electricity generated by more of the new energy power plants, including
                solar and wind power. We strictly modify the calculation rules so that you can clearly see whether the
                new energy power plants are currently doing a good job or not. Also, an hourly estimation of future 48
                hours is available. All of this are integrated into a signal function where the plain data are
                visualized vividly.</p>
            <h1 class="intro_title">The signal light function</h1>
            <div class="traffic_light"></div>
            <p class="intro_description">The rule is very simple. While the data comes out a <span
                    style='color: brown;'>red</span> light, probably the new
                energy power plants are not even working due to the low power. Shutting down some of the electronic
                devices is recommended which can evidently loosen the burden of the fossil plants. <span
                    style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Yellow</span> light comes out when the new energy power plants are
                working not very efficiently which means it is better to use only appliances with not too high
                electricity consumption. Finally, if the <span style="color: darkseagreen;">green</span> light is on,
                that stands for new energy power plants dealing considerable electricity amount. Now is the best time to
                consume electricity while being environmental friendly.</p>
